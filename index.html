            <p>Do you like vanilla ice cream? It may not be everyone’s favorite, but it is a staple flavor arguably
                more popular than chocolate. Stop and think for a moment why that might be. For starters, it’s a
                foundational flavor: Many other flavors use vanilla ice cream as a base and just increase the
                complexity from minor adjustments—<em>just stir in some toppings</em>—to extreme perversions—<em>the
                    poorly conceived black licorice flavor</em>. The foundational nature makes it perfect to serve on
                its own
                and enhance with toppings to your own liking without running the risk of offending guests or other
                household members with an abomination (still looking at you, licorice ice cream).</p>
            <p>It’s simplicity also makes it incredibly versatile. Serve it on its own in a bowl or cone, alongside pie
                or cake, or in your root beer. Heck, you can even throw a scoop on top of your pancakes and give it a
                fancy French name. There are very few <strong>wrong</strong> occasions for vanilla ice cream.</p>
            <p>Why the analysis of vanilla ice cream when I should be talking about myself? Well… I am vanilla ice
                cream. There is no task where I am the wrong fit; I may not be the expert in any one niche and that
                frees me to competently approach any challenge. </p>
            <p>
                In short, I get the job done. I get it done in a way that leaves everyone satisfied. And I do it all
                without fanfare or drama.
